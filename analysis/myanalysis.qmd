```{r}
library(tidyverse)
here::i_am("analysis/myanalysis.qmd")
library(here)
```

```{r}
df <- read_csv(here("data/levinson_2007_particles.csv"))

```

Let's observe some funky stuff with working directories. We're going to run
the following code three different ways, and see what result we get:

 - with code set to output inline
 - with code set to output in console
 - rendering to html

```{r}
getwd()
```
